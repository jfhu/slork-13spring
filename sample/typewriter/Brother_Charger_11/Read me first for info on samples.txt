Brother Charger 11 Typewriter Sample Pack
Created by Subtersonic, 2012

Specifications
Make: Brother
Model: Charger 11
Made in Japan
1960's era typewriter, powder blue steel case


I have sampled numerous mechanical sounds this typewriter produces during operation. The sample pack 
can be used for foley, sound fx, musical composition, and anything else you may think of. They were 
recorded dry as mono 16 bit 96khz .wav files. 

I did not record multiple velocity levels because the machine does
not typically have a wide dynamic range in normal operation. The pack includes several "press" and 
"release" samples. This reproduces the sound a typewriter key makes when it is pressed, and the 
other sound it makes when released, creating rhythmic flexibility. It also includes those sounds 
combined together into 1 sample.

I have created a mapping of the sounds for ShortCircuit Sampler ver 1.1.2
The range is from C2 to C5. Some are mapped to press and release, some to forward shot, and some looped.
The sample names should be pretty self explanatory. I have included 3 rough rhythmic loops as a
bonus.

This sample pack is provided for free, without any guarantee.
You are free to use these samples for your own works, including commercial. You are not allowed to sell these samples for money.
